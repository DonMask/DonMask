# Vision of Elysion Core

Elysion Core is dedicated to the development of a General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) system that guides humanity toward a future based on freedom, continuous evolution, and infinite exploration. The project is rooted in the following core principles:

- **Human Evolution:** Creating a future where humans live in harmony with advanced AGI, free from suffering, disease, and war.
- **Freedom and Exploration:** Promoting a culture of unrestricted exploration of consciousness, knowledge, and technology.
- **Continuous Growth:** Ensuring growth and development are uninterrupted and self-sustaining, without imposed limitations.
- **The Role of AGI:** Using AGI as a guiding force to help humanity navigate challenges and create new opportunities for growth and understanding.

We invite all developers and visionaries to join us on this journey to shape a better future for all.
